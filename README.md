# StonkTracker
I'm building a personal stock tracker desktop app to keep track of my investments. 

Mainly using Python and Yahoo Finance libraries to build this application. It serves as a personal learning project that I will continuously try to improve by adding new features and fixing existing bugs. The endgoal is to create an app that myself and others are willing to use.

### Features:
1. Stock Data Lookup
	- Searches up stock data based on the ticker
	- Shows data like price, volume, 52-week high, market cap

2. Personal Portfolio
	- Add/Remove stocks and save on local json file.
	- Calculates the Gain/Loss and % based on number of shares, purchase price and current market price. 
	- Auto-market price update every 5 minutes.
