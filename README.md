# StonkTracker
Building a personal stock tracker desktop app to keep track of my investments. 

Mainly using Python and Yahoo Finance libraries to build this application. It serves as a personal learning project that I will continuously try to improve by adding new features and fixing existing bugs. The endgoal is to create an app that myself and others are willing to use.
